    <h2 class="text-4xl my-4 text-[#075985]">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const:</h2>
    <p class="text-2xl my-2 text-[#0369a1]">=> The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const
        variable is block scope.
        It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.</p>
    <h2 class="text-4xl my-4 text-[#075985]">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
    <p class="text-2xl my-2 text-[#0369a1]">=> Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or
        a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns
        the type
        as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>
    <h2 class="text-4xl my-4 text-[#075985]">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
    <p class="text-2xl my-2 text-[#0369a1]">=> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can
        connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the
        REST,
        or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
